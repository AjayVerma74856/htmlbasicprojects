    <p style="background-color: blueviolet;">Lord Rama, a revered deity in Hinduism, is the seventh avatar of Vishnu and the hero of the ancient epic, the Ramayana. Known for his unwavering devotion to dharma (righteousness), Rama is depicted as an ideal prince, husband, and son. His life story is marked by his exile to the forest, the abduction of his wife Sita by the demon king Ravana, and his heroic quest to rescue her with the help of his loyal brother Lakshmana and the monkey god Hanuman. Rama's adherence to virtue and duty, despite numerous trials, exemplifies the ideals of heroism and integrity, making him a symbol of moral and ethical conduct.</p>
