    <p style="background-color: thistle;">Lord Vishnu, a central figure in Hinduism, is known as the "Preserver" of the universe and a key member of the Trimurti, alongside Brahma the "Creator" and Shiva the "Destroyer." Vishnu is often depicted with a dark blue complexion, four arms holding a conch shell, a discus, a mace, and a lotus, symbolizing his divine attributes and powers. He is celebrated for his incarnations, or avatars, among which the most famous are Rama and Krishna, each of whom plays a crucial role in preserving cosmic order and guiding humanity. Vishnuâ€™s divine acts and teachings emphasize righteousness, compassion, and the protection of dharma (cosmic law).</p>
