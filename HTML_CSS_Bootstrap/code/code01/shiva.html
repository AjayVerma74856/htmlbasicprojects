    <p style="background-color: antiquewhite;">Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism, is revered as the "Destroyer" in the Holy Trinity or Trimurti, which also includes Brahma the "Creator" and Vishnu the "Preserver." Often depicted with a third eye, a serpent around his neck, and a crescent moon on his head, Shiva embodies both ascetic and householder aspects.</p>
